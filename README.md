# ARMGDDNRequest

This is the official ARMGDDN Games Request Userscript, utilizing Tampermonkey. (Violentmonkey has been tested and works too. Greasemonkey might work too, hasn't been tested yet though.)

## How to install

To install, you will need the Tampermonkey Browser Extension, which you can find [here](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)

Make sure to download the REGULAR ONE, not a beta, not a Legacy or classic, just plain Tampermonkey.


After installing it, click on [this Link](https://github.com/holyarahippo06/ARMGDDNRequest/blob/main/ARMGDDNRequest.user.js?raw=true) to install the Request script.


## How to Use

To use the extension, visit the [steam website](https://store.steampowered.com). Once there, look up a game and enter the page for the specific game.

If you want to request a Half-Life: Alyx Mod from the Steam Workshop, the procedure is the same. Go to the [Half-Life Alyx's workshop website](https://steamcommunity.com/app/546560/workshop/), click the workshop item you want. This time, the window will be above the "subscribe" element. Fill in your Telegram @ and Submit.

Done. You should get a confirmation of the request going through, from here on, we got your request and make sure to read the rules of the group. Especially Rule 3. Otherwise it'll be an immediate warn, if not more.
